# Build samples

## overview

* * *

This is a note for this repo, should give some info on how
to build these subprojects.

## tooling

* * *

The targeted audience I've tested this on is **Windows 10**,
**Mac OSX**, **ChromeOS**, and **Linux** users. This project
uses [Python](https://www.python.org/) `3.8.x` and newer.

## Setup, Compile and Install

* * *

We should make sure the test run with no failed test cases:

```console
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pytest test/run_tests.py
```

Installing should be easy. We install the application like so:

```console
python3 setup.py install
```

And finally we run this cool application:

```console
prog
```
